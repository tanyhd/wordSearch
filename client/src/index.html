  <p>A word search game is a fun and challenging puzzle game where players have to find a set of words hidden within a grid of letters. </p>
  <p>To play the game, you first need to enter a list of words, separated by commas, that you will be searching for in the grid. For example, you might enter "car,dog,mouse" as your list of words. </p>
  <p>Next, you will need to enter the size of the grid that you want to generate. For example, you might enter "15" to generate a 15x15 grid.</p>
  <p>Once you have entered your list of words and selected the grid size, you can click on the "generate" button to create your word search puzzle.</p>
  <p>To play the game, you can click and drag your cursor across the grid to spot the words in the grid. Have fun!</p>
